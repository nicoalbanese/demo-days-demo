The code from my Demo Days talk.

This project (`index.ts`) is a VC due dilligence agent that scrapes a bunch of information from different sources, then generates a deal memo.

There are 9 (numbered and sequential) branches that go through the various states of the file. `9` is the final state.


To get started, clone the repo, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`, and fill in the values. Then, pick your branch and run `pnpm run dev`.
