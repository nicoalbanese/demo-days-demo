- hey guys
- build a basic streamText and response to ask about dd for a company (granola)
- it's not working, and this makes sense because the language model doesnt have this info in it's training data, so we need to add a tool
  a tool is aptly named a tool because it augments the language models abilities in some way. you can think of it similarily to if we had a web browser in front of us.
- add a basic tool (scrapeWebsite) with exa
  "whats the first thing we would do in this process?", well we'd go to the companies website of course
- ok we're generating a tool but the language model isn't using that to responsd to use, we need to add a nother step
